<p>A true bike fanatic most likely has at least once scribbled down a Leh trip in his teenage that he dreams to complete in his life. And as we, grow the mere names of such places turns into expense calculations before it finally makes into the final plan of our expedition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>India, a country with 29 states, leaves a rider with endless traditions and cultures to explore. And what’s a better way than covering those on two-wheels? Here are some of the lesser-known places that can be equally enthralling and soothing for the soul of a rider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Leh Bike Tour</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nothing can be better than a bike ride to relish the beauty of Leh. Valleys, Sunrise, Mountains and scenic views are only a small part of the town. An ideal expedition would be a post-mid-June ride to some of the popular sites such as Shanti Stupa, Leh Palace, Ladakh Hall of Fame and Spituk Gumpa.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9796,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossless,ret_img,w_750,h_446/https://redpandaadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Leh-1.jpg" alt="Leh Motorcycle trip" class="wp-image-9796"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 6-7 day ride can take you through some of the most scenic places in Leh including Nubra Valley and the Hunder Sand Dunes. There is no better way than riding a bike to explore the flora and fauna of Leh. However, needless to say, a true rider neither has any roads nor any maps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Jaipur Udaipur</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You cannot fully understand a culture of a state until you dig deeper into its interiors. Rajasthan, the ‘land of Maharajas’, is one of the most culturally enriched states of India and what’s a better way than a bike ride to explore deep-seated cultures?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9795} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossless,ret_img,w_750,h_446/https://redpandaadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jaipur.jpg" alt="Jaipur Udaipur Trip" class="wp-image-9795"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Jaipur-Udaipur-Mount Abu-Pushkar expedition can be your gateway to experience the local culture and cuisine of the state. The jungle safari through Ranthambore followed by a ride around Lake Pichola and a visit to various Jain temples is something that falls in the common ground of all the riders who have ever wished to visit the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Manali to Spiti Valley</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The best way to sink in the exhilarating beauty of a 569km journey from Manali to Spiti can be nothing other than a bike ride.&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://redpandaadventures.com/motorcycle-tours/leh-khardung-la-bike-tour-via-spiti-valley-12-days-royal-enfield/">A 12-day trip to Spiti valley from Manali</a>&nbsp;</strong>can yield you some of the most beautiful sightseeing experiences at places such as the Chandra Taal Lake, Kee monastery, Pin Valley, Tabo, Naka, Kalpa, Sangla, and Shoja.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9798} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossless,ret_img,w_800,h_600/https://redpandaadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/spiti.jpg" alt="Spiti Valley Trip" class="wp-image-9798"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most common routes taken to Spiti is Manali – Rohtang Pass – Kunzum Pass – Losar – Kaza and Delhi – Shimla – Narkanda – Kinnaur Valley – Tabo – Kaza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sikkim Darjeeling Biking Tour</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A bike-ride to Darjeeling is as popular as the hill station is known for its trekking expeditions. A trip in the month of October, just before the onset of winter, can help you explore some of the most beautiful sights through the 650km journey. A journey through the friendly small towns of Ravangla, Lachung and others will let you have an exhilarating experience in exploring the traditions and cultures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9794} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossless,ret_img,w_750,h_446/https://redpandaadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Darjeeling.jpg" alt="Sikkim Darjeeling Biking Tour" class="wp-image-9794"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most common route followed is Siliguri – Pelling – Ravangla – Gangtok – Lachung – Zero Point – Lachen – Gangtok – Padamchen – Siliguri.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>East Coast Road: Chennai to Pondicherry</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A trip from the southern city of Chennai to its neighbouring Union Territory Puducherry might be a short one but filled with some of the most beautiful sceneries of South India. The East Coast Road, till this date, remains as one of the most well-maintained roads of India.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9797} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossless,ret_img,w_1024,h_682/https://redpandaadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Puducherry-1024x682.jpg" alt="chennai trip" class="wp-image-9797"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The close to 156km journey will be filled with scenes of lush green rice paddies, calm oceans and beautiful beaches. Scanty rainfall in the state of Tamil Nadu works in favour of the riders with the roads being rideable throughout the year.</p>

		<title>Packing The Perfect Medical Kit For Your Motorcycle Trip</title>
		<link>http://localhost/wp524/2019/10/31/packing-the-perfect-medical-kit-for-your-motorcycle-trip/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Challenges and adversities are the prefaces of the Motorcycling trip textbook. Many times, these are unavoidable. Unpredictable weather and unfriendly traffic only start the long list of ‘ways things can go wrong’ on a&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://redpandaadventures.com/motorcycle-tours/">motorcycle trip</a></strong>. Hence preparing yourself for such a situation might the only way to go about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Packing a medical-kit for your trip is similar to having sweets on Diwali, you either eat none or eat too much. Carrying the right medical supplies might be one of the worst dilemmas faced by a first timer and quite often, finding the perfect balance between too less and too much can be frustrating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hence, here are some of the things that your medical kit should not lack before the onset of your grand journey.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one thing that minor and major falls have in common are abrasions or bruises. However, dusting off an open wound with your hand and neglecting it as it is might pose a greater threat. The threat of an infection. Dirt homes numerous bacteria, and a bruised skin is its easiest entry. Bacteria such as Clostridia present in the dirt can cause severe (sometimes lethal) infections such as tetanus or gas gangrene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hence, one should always carry a disinfectant soap in the medic kit. In situations without water one can always opt for a handy pack of pre-moistened antibacterial wipes. Apart from that, an excellent alternative for antibacterial soaps might be any alcohol based disinfectant which can be applied directly. The pH value of alcohol makes it difficult for the bacteria to survive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Complementary to the first, the second most crucial thing to carry would be a dressing kit including nothing more than a non-stick bandage and medical tapes to keep the dressing in place. Cleaning a minor abrasion with a disinfectant would most likely suffice. However, in the event of minor bleeding, the best solution is to clog it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Things might get a little more challenging in case of a severe crash and one of the things that become the most difficult is to work with a stable mind. In the event of a major accident, primary instincts should always make you call for emergency medical services (EMS). Technology can be one of the most useful tools during times like this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Downloading your route offline and marking the hospitals is as important as physically packing a medic kit. However, in the event when the ambulance might not reach the spot. There are certain things that must be done.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key to extinguishing the situation starts with a solution for bleeding. Most of the times, the best way to go about it is to stop the blood from reaching the wound, which brings us to the third most essential element in the kit, a tourniquet. A tourniquet is essentially a tight band that will stop the flow of blood from your heart to the wound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This reduces the blood pressure around the ruptured arteries and reduces the chances of excess bleeding. A common preconceived notion about tourniquets might say that it is harmful. However, it should be noted that a tourniquet should not be tied for more than a few hours. And should be taken off only by professionals.</p>

		<title>Why Riding In The Himalayas Is So Different From Riding In The Rest Of India</title>
		<link>http://localhost/wp524/2019/10/31/why-riding-in-the-himalayas-is-so-different-from-riding-in-the-rest-of-india/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>India. A land of many weathers, terrains, and peoples. This country has such a varied landscape and ecology that it deserves to be its own independent continent. A long coastline courtesy of the peninsular layout of the country, a desert to the west which got separated by the Indus river delta, a multitude of rivers crisscrossing the length and breadth of the country, verdant forests dotting the landscape, and last but not the least, multiple mountain ranges including the Sahyadri, Nilgiri, Satpura, and the Himalaya, tallest of them all and the tallest in the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 25 major mountain peaks in the world, 19 of which call the Himalaya home. The five tallest peaks are also situated in the tallest mountain range on this planet. To put things in perspective, Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in the African continent rises 19,314 ft above sea level. Border Roads Organisation India recently constructed a restricted access mountain pass in the Himalaya that lies at a height of 19,300 ft above mean sea level. The mountain pass is called Umling La and is currently accorded the honour of the highest motorable road in the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9758,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossless,ret_img,w_1024,h_768/https://redpandaadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Red-Panda-Adventures-Himalaya-2.jpg" alt="Red-Panda-Adventures-Himalaya Mountain Tour" class="wp-image-9758"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So what sets the Himalayan experience apart from the rest of the places India has to offer? Surely other mountain ranges in the country are also equally challenging? The answer is two-fold. Firstly, the geology of the Himalaya is vastly different from the other ranges owing to the fact of these mountains being pushed up above the sea due to tectonic activity. The Himalaya are still changing with some peaks sinking and others rising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the constant unstable tectonic activity, mineral-rich strata of the Earth’s crust has been raised to the surface to form these massive mountains. None of these minerals or pure elements support the growth of plants and greenery. Whatever flourishes in the Himalaya is usually next to a mountainous river basin. This makes the Himalaya the highest desert in the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This leads us to the second part of the answer. Owing to the sheer altitude the mountain range commands over the surrounding terrain, weather is a volatile element in the Himalaya. Rivers are prone to flash floods, valleys are prone to cloudbursts, and meltwater from the many glaciers dotting the mountains regularly disrupts the lives of the natives and travelers that abound this place. Add to that the height of almost all notable places above sea level, and you have to add another layer to the mix: altitude sickness. At around 11,000 ft and above sea level, the air begins to get thinner leading to low oxygen levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The smallest mountain pass in the Himalaya is the Jalori pass in Himachal Pradesh which sits more than 9,000 ft above sea level. Two of the more popular mountain passes, Zoji La in Jammu &amp; Kashmir as well as Rohtang Pass, also in Himachal Pradesh are more than 13,000 ft in altitude. So trouble brews early in these mountains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9761,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossless,ret_img,w_1024,h_768/https://redpandaadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Red-Panda-Adventures-Himalaya-5.jpg" alt="Himalaya Biking Tour" class="wp-image-9761"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Additionally, due to sparse tree cover on the steep and tall sides of the Himalaya, the entire mountain range keeps throwing up random landslides all over. Some are little more than a clump of shooting rocks while others are so massive the Indian Army and BRO needs four to five days to clear the road of the debris. The weather is generally cold up there which leads to blizzards that can snow in critical routes for days on end. Indeed, an entire valley (Spiti) lies out of bounds to outsiders for six months of the year due to snow blocking access.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a final challenge, the Himalaya acts as a natural border between China and India, with half of Jammu &amp; Kashmir currently occupied by Pakistan, making border roads a very volatile location. The roads have been theatres of battle in the past, with monuments to the losses erected in Kargil and Rezang La.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite all of the above factors that seem to be against the idea of a good time on a ride through these mountains, the Himalaya still attracts more and more visitors every year, from India as well as the entire world. One of the biggest reasons why the mighty mountains attract so many visitors is the sheer size of each one of these proud structures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Struggling through treacherous, life-threatening terrain, braving inclement weather, side-stepping freak natural calamities that regularly occur throughout the range, when you reach your destination and finally get to gaze at the mountains, you are awed and humbled by their commanding yet welcoming presence. You know you will never see anything as massive as the Himalaya anywhere, at least not on this planet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":9762,"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossless,ret_img,w_768,h_1024/https://redpandaadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Red-Panda-Adventures-Himalaya-1.jpg" alt="Himalayan Mountain Ranges" class="wp-image-9762"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During our childhood days, we would draw outlandish shapes for landscapes and colour them equally weirdly, never knowing the fact that such places do exist on the Earth. But they do. The Himalaya is a kind of mountain range that does not conform to a set pattern when it comes to geological formations. You can see red rocks somewhere, while huge conical sandstone formations will welcome you in another part of the range.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to their massive dimensions, these mountains also influence the play of light and shadows around them, leading to new and unique views each day. While it has to be experienced to be believed, the Himalaya does really hypnotise with its raw, unparalleled beauty. You cease to acknowledge the fact that this place is in fact, a desert.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it’s not a request; it’s an earnest exhortation:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://redpandaadventures.com/motorcycle-tours/himachal-bike-tour-kinnaur-lahaul-spiti-valley-10-days-royal-enfield/">Ride among the Himalaya once in your lifetime</a></strong>!</p>
